# Streamfu

Functional programming utilities for working with streams in JS/TS in a really intuitive and easy way.

## Introduction

Streams are async collections of data, conceptually similar to arrays, but very different in practice. Streams are a powerful tool for working with async data, but they can be hard to work with. This package provides a set of utilities to work with streams in a functional way, making it easier to work with them.

If you know how to do something with arrays, you can do it with streams too!

## Usage

This package provides a simple and functional way to work with streams in JS/TS. To use it, you can install it from your favorite package manager:

- npm: `npx jsr add @sgmonda/streamfu`
- yarn: `yarn dlx jsr add @sgmonda/streamfu`
- pnpm: `pnpm dlx jsr add @sgmonda/streamfu`
- deno: `deno add jsr:@sgmonda/streamfu`
- bun: `bunx jsr add @sgmonda/streamfu`

Then, just import the module from your code:

```typescript
import * as streamfu from "@sgmonda/streamfu"
```

Enjoy it!
